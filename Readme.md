<h3>Redux:-</h3>
<p>Redux is a powerful state management library for javascript applications ie:- React. <br/>Some key points about Redux are:- 

<ol>

  <li>
  Predictable State Management:
   <ul>
    <li>Redux provides a predictable way to manage the state of your application.</li>
    <li>It follows a unidirectional data flow, making it easier to reason about how data changes over time.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
  Single Store
   <ul>
     <li>Redux maintains a single global store that holds the entire state of your application.</li>
     <li>Components can read data from this store and dispatch actions to update it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
  Actions and Reducers:
   <ul>
     <li>Actions represent events or user interactions (e.g., clicking a button).</li>
     <li>Reducers are pure functions that handle these actions and update the state accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
  React-Redux Integration
   <ul>
     <li>React-Redux is the official package that connects React components with the Redux store.</li>
     <li>It allows components to read data from the store and dispatch actions to update it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ol>
